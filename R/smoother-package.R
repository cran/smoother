#' @description \code{smoother} package for the smoothing of numerical data.
#' 
#' @details \code{smoother} is presently limited to a port of the Matlab 'Gaussian Window' Function, which can be found at 
#' the following URL: \url{http://goo.gl/HGM47U} and should be used on an 'as-is' basis.
#' 
#' For further information (and examples) with regards to utilizing the gaussian window function, 
#' please refer to the \link{smth} function help file
#' @references The Gaussian Smoothing component of the \code{smoother} package has been loosley adapted from the 
#' following works: \url{http://goo.gl/NK79bJ}. In this work, the two tail regions of the data are handled a little
