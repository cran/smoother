\description{
\code{smoother} Package for the Smoothing of Numerical Data
}
\details{
\code{smoother} is presently limited to a port of the
Matlab 'Gaussian Window' Function, as well as a limited
number of moving averages (\code{sma, ema, dema} and
\code{'wma'}). Code for the gaussian window function has
been written locally within this package, however, the
moving averages are called from the \link{TTR} package
(\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html})
and are included as a matter of convenience.

For further information (and examples) with regards to
utilizing the primary helper function, please refer to the
\link{smth} function help file
