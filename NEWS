smoother 1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Added alpha  ('smoother.gaussianwindow.alpha')  option which can be modified globally (default 2.5)
* Added window ('smoother.window') option which can be modified globally (default 0.1, which is 10% of data)
* Added verbose ('smoother.verbose') option which can be modified globally (default FALSE)
* Added method ('smoother.method') option which can be modified globally (default 'gaussian')
* Exposed/Exported smth.gaussian(...) function, rather than using as hidden function. It was previously included as .smth.gaussian(...)
* Added trivial example to the smth.gaussian(...) function now that it has been exposed
* Added elipsis (...) argument to smth function (see ?smth), which can pass variables down the line to the respective specific smoothing techniques.
* Removed any sort of specific argument from the helper function (?smth), in favour of using the elipsis. Arguments are then specific to each function (for example, see ?smth.gaussian)
* Moved all hidden functions to the functions.R file
* Added help file for the global options, see ?smoother.options
* Included some basic Moving Average functions (sma, ema, dema, wma), called from the TTR package and wrapped within the smth(...) helper function.
* Removed 'donttest' directives in documentation

BUG FIXES
* Fixed typo (x not X) in the example provided in the ?smth help file.
